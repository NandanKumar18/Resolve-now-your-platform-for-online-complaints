ResolveNow – Online Complaint Registration and Management System
Introduction:

ResolveNow is a simple web-based application designed to help users submit and manage complaints online. It allows users to register, log in, and raise issues or complaints through a digital platform. The idea is to replace traditional paper-based complaint handling with a faster, more organized system.

This version is built using frontend technologies like React.js, HTML, and CSS. It does not use any backend or database, making it lightweight and ideal for demonstrating the core concept of an online complaint system.

 Objective:

The main goal of this project is to simulate the complaint registration and tracking process through a user-friendly web interface. The system helps improve how complaints are collected and monitored, ensuring they are not lost or ignored.

Features:

1. User Registration and Login  
   Users can create a simple account and log in to access the complaint dashboard.

2. Complaint Submission  
   Users can submit complaints by filling out a form that includes issue details.

3. Complaint List Display  
   Once submitted, the complaints are shown in a list on the user's dashboard.

4. Responsive Interface  
   The design adjusts to different screen sizes like desktop or mobile.

Technologies Used:

- React.js – for building the user interface using components  
- HTML & CSS – for structuring and styling the layout  
- JavaScript – for interactive logic within the application  
- npm & Node.js – for managing dependencies and running the development server  
- VS Code – as the code editor

How It Works:

1. When the app loads, the user is asked to register or log in.
2. After logging in, the user reaches the dashboard where they can submit complaints.
3. Complaints are stored in the browser’s temporary memory using React’s state.
4. The list of complaints is updated instantly and shown below the form.
5. All data is cleared if the page is refreshed, since there is no database yet.



Future Enhancements:

- Connect to a backend like Node.js and MongoDB for real data storage.
- Add user roles (admin, support agent, etc.).
- Allow chat or response features between users and support.
- Implement status tracking for complaints (like pending, in-progress, resolved).
- Enable localStorage to keep data even after refresh.

Conclusion:

ResolveNow is a basic prototype that shows how online complaint management can work using modern web technologies. Even though this version only handles frontend functionality, it lays a solid foundation for future upgrades. It demonstrates an understanding of user interaction, form handling, component-based design, and real-time state updates in React.
